# DennyLoko's dotfiles

This is a personal project of my dotfiles. Use as your wish.

## Links
 1. ``ln -s `pwd`/.vimrc ~/.vimrc``
 2. ``ln -s `pwd`/.vim ~/.vim``
 3. ``ln -s `pwd`/.iterm2 ~/.iterm2``

## Configurations
### iTerm2
Go to iTerm2 preferences by typing <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> and check the box `Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:` under the __Preferences__ section and browse to `~/.iterm2` folder.

### Vim
To handle my Vim plugins I use Vundle, so before continuing it must be installed (you can install it by typing `git submodule update --init` from the repo path).
